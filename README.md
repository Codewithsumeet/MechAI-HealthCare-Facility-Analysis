## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the distribution and accessibility of healthcare facilities in rural areas. The analysis aims to identify gaps in healthcare services, visualize facility coverage, and provide actionable insights to improve rural healthcare infrastructure.

---

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

---

## Data Source(s)
- Rural Health Statistics: Districtwise Health Care Infrastructure (https://ndap.niti.gov.in/dataset/7035)

Execution Steps
1. Clone this repository:
```
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Codewithsumeet/MechAI-HealthCare-Facility-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `src/` folder and run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python analysis.py
   ```

   
4. Processed data files will be available in the `data/` folder.
5. Visualizations will be saved in the `visuals/` folder.
6. The final report and outputs will be in the `output/` folder.

Summary of Results
- Identified regions with inadequate healthcare facilities.
- Generated accessibility metrics, such as the average distance to the nearest healthcare facility.
- Visualized trends and gaps in healthcare distribution using bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots.

---

Challenges Faced
- Incomplete or inconsistent datasets requiring extensive preprocessing.
- Balancing multiple metrics to evaluate healthcare accessibility effectively.
